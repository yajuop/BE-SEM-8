## Introduction

This repository serves as a learning platform for students enrolled in the Bachelor of Engineering program. The assignments focus on practical applications of theoretical concepts learned throughout the semester. Each project aims to enhance understanding and foster skills in programming and data science.

## Topics Covered

The assignments in this repository cover the following topics:

- **C++**: A powerful programming language for system/software development.
- **Deep Learning**: Techniques for training neural networks and understanding complex data.
- **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**: Methods to solve complex problems using parallel processing.
- **Keras**: A high-level neural networks API for building and training models.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computing in Python, providing support for arrays and matrices.
- **OpenMP**: An API for multi-platform shared-memory parallel programming in C, C++, and Fortran.
- **Pandas**: A library providing data structures and data analysis tools for Python.
- **Scikit-learn**: A library for machine learning in Python, offering simple and efficient tools.
- **Seaborn**: A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
- **TensorFlow**: An end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning.

## Installation

To set up the environment for running the assignments, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yajuop/BE-SEM-8.git
   cd BE-SEM-8
   ```

2. **Install required libraries**:
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment. You can create one using `venv` or `conda`.

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Check for additional setup**:
   Some assignments may require specific setup instructions. Refer to the individual assignment directories for more details.

## Usage

Each assignment is structured to allow easy execution. Navigate to the specific assignment directory and follow the instructions in the README file located there. You can also find example datasets and scripts to help you get started.
